# Storefront

Storefront is a sample Ecommerce project, built on top of [Storm Commerce's commerce engine](https://storm.io/).
The project includes some functionality so that the basic commerce processes works.
Use this as a starting point to your own development of commerce apps. Use as example or as a starting kit.

This repository provides a library of code that is right away executable and should work without any changes. 
Read more about the project and what you can do [here](https://storm.io/docs/samplestorefront).

Even though this is a functional project out of the box, it is not tested or ready for production.

## Configuration and execution
The [appsettings.json](Storefront/appsettings.json) file contains the configuration of how to connect to Storm´s SaaS platform. Read about how to change the setup [here](https://storm.io/docs/samplestorefront).
This .net core solution can be run on a local machine (like IIS Express) or using Docker, which needs to be setup separately.
