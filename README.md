# Storefront

Storefront is a sample Ecommerce project, built on top of [Storm Commerce's commerce engine](https://storm.io/).
The project includes some functionality so that the basic commerce processes works.
Use this as a starting point to your own development of commerce apps. Use as example or as a starting kit.

This repository provides a library of code that is right away executable and should work without any changes. 
Read more about the project and what you can do [here](https://storm.io/docs/samplestorefront).

Even though this is a functional project out of the box, it is not tested or ready for production.

## Configuration and execution
The [appsettings.json](Storefront/appsettings.json) file contains the configuration of how to connect to Stormï¿½s SaaS platform. Read about how to change the setup [here](https://storm.io/docs/samplestorefront).
This .net core solution can be run on a local machine (like IIS Express) or using Docker, which needs to be setup separately.

## Dependancies
This sample is dependant on .net Core and Vue.js. It uses a commerce template from wrapboostrap [Boland](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/boland-modern-online-shop-template-WB01P97L2).
The template is licensed for use with this project, but you can also easily buy and change to any other teamplate from the wrapboostrap marketplace. There is some documentation on how to do that [here](https://storm.io/docs/samplestorefront).
